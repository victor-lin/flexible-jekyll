This past weekend, my performance group won **1st place** at a campus-wide talent show!!! It was our 1st time placing in top 3 and 2nd year participating.

The theme of this year’s show was *Happiness is...*. It was very broad, but we wanted to tell a story. It was perfect. We were so focused on the show that we forgot to set up a camera to record it. Here's a decent recording from my sister's iPhone.
