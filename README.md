# victorlin.github.io

This is a fork of the [flexible-jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll) theme by [artemsheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko). Main difference is having the sidebar contents for the main page, and obviously my personal content.

The website can be found at [victorl.in](https://victorl.in/), hosted generously by GitHub Pages.
