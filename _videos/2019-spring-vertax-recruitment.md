## Description

University of Florida's Vertax Diabolo Performance Group Spring 2019 Recruitment.

This video was filmed and created to promote the presence of Vertax and knowledge of the diabolo.
In the United States, it is a relatively unknown prop only popularized by traditional circus acts.

The diabolo (or Chinese yo-yo) is a traditional Chinese toy that has evolved over the centuries.
Vertax is the University of Florida's first and only diabolo performance group,
showcasing the traditional toy with a modern twist.
