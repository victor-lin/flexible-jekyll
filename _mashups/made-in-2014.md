## Lyrics

Can't be sleepin'<br>
Keep on waking<br>
Without the woman next to me (I will never let you down)<br>
Guilt is burning<br>
Inside I'm hurting<br>
This ain't a feeling I can keep<br>
<br>
Am I wrong? (Oh oh)<br>
The map that leads to you<br>
Ain't nothing I can do<br>
The map that leads to you (I will never let you down)<br>
Am I wrong?<br>
The map that leads to you<br>
Ain't nothing I can do<br>
The map that leads to you<br>
Following, following, following<br>
<br>
Am I wrong? (oh oh)<br>
I can’t remember to forget you<br>
All I wanna do is drive home to you, baby<br>
Am I wrong? (oh oh)<br>
I keep forgetting I should let you go<br>
All I wanna do is take you downtown, baby<br>
<br>
I don't wanna go to school<br>
I just wanna break the rules<br>
Boys and girls across the world<br>
I will never let you down<br>
<br>
(Baby)<br>
All your love will make us ache<br>
All I wanna do is drive home to you, baby<br>
All my love, I know we're you'll find it<br>
All my love's up on the mountain tops<br>
<br>
Am I wrong? (baby) (oh oh)<br>
I can’t remember to forget you<br>
All I wanna do is drive home to you, baby<br>
Am I wrong? (oh oh)<br>
I keep forgetting I should let you go<br>
The map that leads to you (there’s no going back)<br>
<br>
First thing's first, I'm the realest (realest)<br>
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (let them feel it)<br>
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness<br>
I could hold you down (boom boom boom clap)<br>
About a week ago<br>
<br>
All I want is bad chicks<br>
I don't want no mediocre<br>
Don't want no mediocre<br>
I don't want no mediocre (wiggle wiggle) no<br>
Bad mamasitas<br>
Ain't no mediocre<br>
Don't want no mediocre<br>
I won't hit no mediocre (oh oh) yeah<br>
<br>
I'm so fancy<br>
You already know<br>
I'm in the fast lane<br>
From L.A. to Tokyo<br>
I'm so fancy<br>
Can't you taste this gold?<br>
Remember my name<br>
'Bout to blow<br>
<br>
Ain't it fun<br>
All I need is a little love in my life<br>
Living in the real world<br>
Love me harder (love me harder)<br>
Ain't it good<br>
I need a little loving tonight<br>
Being all alone<br>
Love me harder (love me harder)<br>
<br>
(oooohooooohoooh) Love me, love me, love me<br>
(oooohooooohoooh) Harder, harder, harder<br>
<br>
Uh, tell 'em where I'm from<br>
Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby<br>
From SoCal, Hollywood to the slums<br>
Gettin' faded in the European swervin’ name (talk dirty to me)<br>
West side, east coast where you at<br>
Just got to New York like a net on a jet<br>
To London (when in New York I be parking right on Madison)<br>
Like the whole damn world took effect to Ferg (ah lahmlahlah)<br>
<br>
Take all of me (is, is you ‘bout it?)<br>
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals (talk dirty to me)<br>
Take all of me (I can read your body language)<br>
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals<br>
Right here with me (baby I’m)<br>
<br>
Baby I’m (one less problem without you)<br>
Baby I’m (one less problem without you)<br>
Baby I’m (shake it off, I shake it off)<br>
<br>
I’ve got one less problem without you [x4]<br>
Ah lahmlahlah<br>
<br>
Taking me higher than I've ever been before<br>
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more (never)<br>
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling<br>
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning<br>
<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
There’s an endless road to rediscover<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker<br>
<br>
Now I've got you in my space<br>
We’ll be shooting starships passing by (I’m stronger than I’ve been before)<br>
Got you shackled in my embrace<br>
We’ll be burning up like neon lights (just run them red lights) (never)<br>
<br>
This is the part when I say I don't want ya<br>
I'm stronger than I've been before<br>
This is the part when I break free<br>
'Cause I can't resist it no more<br>
<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
Drunk in love (I’m all about that bass, ‘bout that bass)<br>
'Cause I can't resist it no more<br>
Hey brother<br>
Drunk in love (I’m all about that bass, ‘bout that bass)<br>
When I met you in the summer<br>
<br>
Now I've got you in my space<br>
I’m all about that bass, ‘bout that bass (I’m stronger than I’ve been before)<br>
Got you shackled in my embrace<br>
I’m all about that bass, ‘bout that bass (when I met you in the summer)
