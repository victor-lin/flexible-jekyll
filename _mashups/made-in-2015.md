## Lyrics

What do you mean?<br>
I need you the I need you (ah aah ooh)<br>
I need you the I need you (ah aah ooh)<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
<br>
What do you mean?<br>
One last time<br>
(I need you the I need you)<br>
(I need you the I need you)<br>
I just gotta know that your love is true (lo-lo-love me like you do)<br>
<br>
What do you mean?<br>
Nah nah honey, I’m good (I need you the I need you)<br>
I could have another but I probably shouldn’t (I need you the I need you)<br>
I don't like it, no, I love it<br>
<br>
What do you mean?<br>
One more time<br>
(I need you the I need you)<br>
(I need you the I need you)<br>
How deep is your love<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
<br>
Now if we're talking body (is it like the ocean?)<br>
You got a perfect one so put it on me (on you)<br>
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?<br>
<br>
Now if we're talking body (is it like nirvana?)<br>
You got a perfect one so put it on me<br>
And now I know my heart is a ghost town<br>
<br>
How deep is your love?<br>
Waiting just for you<br>
I just gotta know that your love is true<br>
How deep is your love?<br>
Ah aah ooh x3<br>
How deep is your love?<br>
Ah aah ooh x3<br>
<br>
You know you like it but it drives you insane<br>
You know you like it but it drives you insane<br>
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame<br>
What you want, what you gonna do?<br>
<br>
(Cheyenne)<br>
I can't feel my face when I'm with you<br>
(Cheyenne)<br>
But I love it, but I love it<br>
Oh…<br>
<br>
I can't feel my face when I'm with you<br>
Let's just be honest, let's just be real<br>
<br>
All hands on deck<br>
Uh-oh, dancin' past the point of no return<br>
Let go, we can free ourselves of<br>
what you gonna do<br>
<br>
Give it to me, I'm worth it<br>
Baby, I'm worth it (but I love it)<br>
Uh huh I'm worth it<br>
Gimme gimme I'm worth it (but I love it)<br>
<br>
Give it to me, I'm worth it (let's just be honest)<br>
Baby, I'm worth it (but I love it)<br>
Uh huh I'm worth it (let's just be real)<br>
Gimme gimme I'm worth it (but I love it)<br>
<br>
All in the front, all in the back just like that, like that<br>
Imma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that<br>
All in the front, all in the back just like that, like that<br>
Imma blow your mind like that<br>
<br>
Boys seem to like the girls<br>
Who laugh at anything<br>
The ones who get undressed<br>
Before the second date<br>
<br>
(Oh) girls seem to like the boys<br>
Who don't appreciate (that same old love)<br>
(Oh) all the money and the time that it takes<br>
That same old love<br>
<br>
Deep in my bones, I can feel you<br>
Take me back to a time only we knew, hideaway<br>
We never go out of style (out of style)<br>
Would you still love me the same?<br>
<br>
We could waste the night with an old film<br>
Smoke a little weed on the couch in the back room, hideaway<br>
We never go out of style (out of style)<br>
Say you’ll never let me go<br>
<br>
We never go out of style (out of style)<br>
<br>
All hands on deck<br>
All in the front, all in the back just like that, like that<br>
Imma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that<br>
I ain't even know it (even know it) even know it (know it)<br>
All in the front, all in the back just like that, like that<br>
Seen a – th-throw it (th-throw it) th-throw it (throw it)<br>
Imma blow your mind like that (don't be acting like I need you)<br>
<br>
I'm a classic man (no, I ain't tryna flex)<br>
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money<br>
I'm a classic man (if we're talking about sex)<br>
I can do this all day like it ain't nothing<br>
<br>
I'm a classic man (and I'm onto the next)<br>
I'm over here doing what I like<br>
I’m a classic man<br>
Yeah baby I'm a classic man<br>
I'm over here working day and night<br>
<br>
Like, no no no<br>
You took your girl to the club and now she gone-on-on.<br>
Now she asking me when I'm taking her home-ome-ome.<br>
Get met by the street, elegant old fashioned man<br>
Yeah baby I'm a classic man<br>
<br>
I keep my head high<br>
You said keep our business on the low-low (low-low)<br>
I don’t know freedom<br>
'Cause you look even better than the photos (photos)<br>
<br>
Do you feel the buzz or is it just me, trust me<br>
Something in the air, just above me<br>
Something like a dream state<br>
You call it a clean break<br>
Do you feel the buzz, baby?<br>
Do you feel the buzz?<br>
<br>
I know when that hotline bling (oh oh oh)<br>
I only call you when it's half past<br>
<br>
Nobody can drag me<br>
oh yeah, oh yeah<br>
Half past<br>
<br>
I know when that hotline bling (oh oh oh)<br>
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me<br>
<br>
(here, oh oh oh) I'm facing the bottle<br>
(here, oh oh oh) For all of my problems<br>
(here, oh oh oh) These Instagram models<br>
(here, oh oh oh) Are nothing but trouble
