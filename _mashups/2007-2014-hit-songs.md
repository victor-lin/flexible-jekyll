## Lyrics

You shout it out<br>
But I can't hear a word you say<br>
I'm talking loud not saying much<br>
<br>
It's too late to apologize (c’mon, c’mon)<br>
It's too late (I will love, love you tonight)<br>
I said it's too late to apologize (c’mon, c’mon)<br>
It's too late (it’s always a good time)<br>
<br>
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums<br>
In my head, I see you all over me<br>
(Just dance) I, I love you like a love song, baby<br>
(In my head) Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young<br>
<br>
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go<br>
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close<br>
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own<br>
But tonight I need to hold you so close<br>
<br>
I came in like a wrecking ball<br>
I'm only gonna break break ya break break ya heart<br>
All I wanted was to break your walls<br>
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight<br>
<br>
(Don't you worry, don't you worry, child)<br>
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,<br>
Just like the world is our our-our our-our-ours<br>
(Don't you worry, don't you worry, child)<br>
All this time I was finding myself<br>
And I didn't know I was lost (it’s always a good time)<br>
<br>
(Tonight I’m lovin’ you)<br>
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you<br>
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you<br>
All the moves like Jagger<br>
I've got the moves like Jagger<br>
I've got the moves like Jagger (Oppa Gangnam Style)<br>
<br>
Starships were meant to fly<br>
(Op, op, op, op, Oppa Gangnam Style)<br>
(Just dance) Can’t stop ‘cause we’re so high<br>
(Op, op, op, op, Oppa Gangnam Style)<br>
<br>
Ey, sexy lady<br>
I got that summertime, summertime sadness<br>
(Op, op, op, op, Oppa Gangnam Style)<br>
Ey, sexy lady<br>
Where have you been all my life?<br>
(Op, op, op, op, Oppa Gangnam Style)<br>
<br>
Oh oh, sometimes, I get a good feeling<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
If I lose myself tonight<br>
We might not get tomorrow (As long as you love me)<br>
<br>
What's going on on the floor?<br>
Never felt like, felt like this before<br>
(As long as you love me) Keep it cool what's the name of this club?<br>
DJ what you, what you waiting for?<br>
<br>
(Background: Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh...)<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, girl I wanna, yeah, yeah, yeah,<br>
I wanna see you tonight, oh, yeah<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, girl I gotta, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I gotta see you tonight<br>
<br>
(Background: Oh, oh, yeah, oh...)<br>
I won't run, I won't fly<br>
I will never make it by (Let me see your hands)<br>
Without you, without you (Tonight is the night)<br>
<br>
Just dance, gonna be okay, da-doo-doo-doo<br>
Just dance, spin that record babe, da-doo-doo-doo<br>
Just dance, gonna be okay, d-d-d-dance<br>
Dance, dance, just, j-j-just dance<br>
<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah (c’mon, c’mon)<br>
Girl I wanna, yeah, yeah, yeah,<br>
I wanna see you tonight, oh, yeah<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah (c’mon, c’mon)<br>
Girl I gotta, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
(Baby are you down, down, down, down, down)<br>
I gotta see you tonight<br>
<br>
(Background: Oh, oh, yeah, oh...)<br>
I won't run, I won't fly<br>
I will never make it by (Let me see your hands)<br>
Without you, without you (Even if the sky is falling down)<br>
