The diabolo is a prop that originated in China. It is popular in [many countries](https://www.diabolo-ida.org/our-members-1), and the community of diabolo players is growing. Many consider this a sport/hobby, myself included.

## VERTAX DIABOLO PERFORMANCE GROUP

In 2015, I co-founded a diabolo (Chinese yo-yo) performance group at the University of Florida.
